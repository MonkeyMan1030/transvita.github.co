            <h2>Our Research</h2>
           <p>  Since our founding in 2014, We have worked tirelessly to create a better future for America. Our founder Cheryl Barnes discovered what would later be know as "the gay gene" back in 2012,
         by the year 2014 she found a way to remove this gene. Our first tests were successful but were very expensive as they used RadioTherapy, now after 9 years of research we have created a one time vaccine that targets, and removes this gene.</p>
        <section class="Our Goals">
            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>Our end Goal is to create a perfect peaceful world with no Errors at all.</p>

    <p>Eradicating The Gay Gene: Our first goal to meet by the end of the calender year is to remove the gay gene from existence. Through our research this genetic deformity orginated around 3000 years ago through birth defects caused by incest, with our studies we found the exact chromosomal pair that causes this issue.</p>

    <p>The Reversing of Yakub's Work: Our next goal once we complete the goal previous is to reverse the work of famous scientist Yakub, before 4500 BCE there was never any conflict or problem on earth, but the second Yakub completed his research is when all the world's problems started.</p>
